# cgpa_calculator.cpp
A cgpa_calculator.cpp is a C++ program that computes a student's Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) from semester-level data. The usual approach:  1. For each semester (or course), obtain credit-hours and a grade value (often a grade point like 10/9/8 or an SGPA for the semester).
